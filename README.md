# pendulumSim

A javascript pendulum simulation with p5.js for [sambrunacini.com](http://sambrunacini.com/)

The latest released version is available live in the browser on [plotter.sambrunacini.com](http://plotter.sambrunacini.com/PendulumSimulation/)

The simulation supports arbitrary amplitude single and double pendulums. This means that the pendulums can have any angle relative to the downward, and all the calculations will still work correctly (the most difficult quantity to calculate for this is the period). This repo also includes a an embeddable plot library, which was built to plot quantities against time as the simulation runs.
